Actually, it ain't that hard. I would even say it's kind of easy, like, there is so many words and synonyms out there - emptiness, void and... Ok, actually, this where my ideas end for now. Maybe this isn't easy after all.

This one is nasty!

So, actually, that wasn't the last commit, this is what happens when you don't read the description of the task!

Don't worry, I actually read the task. I just forgot about this point. Really!
